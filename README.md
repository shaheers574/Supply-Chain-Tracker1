Supply Chain Tracker
Project Description
Supply Chain Tracker is a blockchain-based solution that provides complete transparency and traceability for products throughout their entire supply chain journey. Built on Solidity and deployed on Core Testnet 2, this smart contract system enables manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to track products from origin to final destination with immutable records.
The system creates a digital twin of physical products on the blockchain, recording every step of the supply chain process including manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, and retail distribution. Each interaction is timestamped and cryptographically secured, ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering.
Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize supply chain management by creating a decentralized, transparent, and trustworthy system that:

Eliminates Counterfeit Products: Provides authentic product verification through blockchain immutability
Enhances Consumer Trust: Gives consumers complete visibility into product origins and journey
Streamlines Compliance: Automates regulatory compliance and audit trails
Reduces Operational Costs: Eliminates intermediaries and reduces paperwork through automation
Promotes Sustainability: Enables tracking of sustainable and ethical sourcing practices

Technical Architecture
Smart Contract Functions
Core Functions:

createProduct() - Creates new products in the supply chain
transferProduct() - Transfers ownership and updates location
trackProduct() - Retrieves complete supply chain history

Utility Functions:

authorizeStakeholder() - Grants stakeholder permissions
revokeStakeholder() - Revokes stakeholder access
deactivateProduct() - Deactivates products
getSupplyChainLength() - Returns history length
isStakeholderAuthorized() - Checks authorization status

Data Structures
soliditystruct Product {
    uint256 id;
    string name;
    string description;
    address manufacturer;
    uint256 timestamp;
    string currentLocation;
    address currentOwner;
    bool isActive;
}

struct SupplyChainStep {
    address stakeholder;
    string location;
    string action;
    uint256 timestamp;
    string remarks;
}
